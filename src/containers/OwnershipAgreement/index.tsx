                This "Owner Agreement" is by and between Under Armour, Inc. ("Licensor") and the individual or entity
                that owns a Digital Asset (as defined below) (the "Owner"), and is effective as of the date ownership of
                the Digital Asset is transferred to the Owner (the "Effective Date").
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                OWNER ACKNOWLEDGES RECEIPT AND UNDERSTANDING OF THIS OWNER AGREEMENT, AND AGREES TO BE BOUND BY ITS
                TERMS. OWNER'S ACCEPTANCE OF A DIGITAL ASSET SHALL BE DEEMED ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS AND CONSENT TO BE
                GOVERNED THEREBY. IF OWNER DOES NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, THIS LICENSE AUTOMATICALLY
                TERMINATES.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                In consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants set forth herein and for other good and
                valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be
                bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                1. LICENSES & RESTRICTIONS.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                1.1 NFT. “NFTs” are non-fungible tokens, ownership of which are registered on a blockchain. An NFT sold
                or otherwise transferred to Owner pursuant to this Agreement shall be a “Digital Asset.” The Digital
                Asset(s) are associated with digital objects (which may include images and/or other digital works)
                (“Digital Object(s)”). As detailed below, Owner may own a Digital Asset, but shall have only a limited
                license to the Digital Object(s) subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein. Holder of the NF3
                Digital Asset will be referred to as the “Main Asset” in this ownership agreement.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                1.2. Digital Object(s). The Digital Object(s) are subject to copyright and other intellectual property
                protections, which rights are and shall remain owned by Licensor or third parties.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                1.3. Licenses. (a) Main Asset. Upon a valid transfer of Main Asset to Owner, Licensor hereby grants
                Owner a limited, transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty free license to use, publish and display the
                Digital Object(s) associated with the Main Asset during the Term, subject to Owner's compliance with the
                terms and conditions set forth herein, including without limitation, the restrictions in Section 1.4
                below, solely for the following purposes: (a) for their own personal, non-commercial use; or (ii) to
                display the Main Asset for resale. Upon expiration of the Term or breach of any conditions of this Owner
                Agreement by Owner, all license rights shall immediately terminate.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                1.4. License Restrictions. The Digital Object(s) provided pursuant to this Owner Agreement are licensed,
                not sold, and Owner receives no title to or ownership of the Digital Object(s) or the intellectual
                property rights therein. Except for the license expressly set forth herein, no other rights (express or
                implied) to the Digital Object(s) are granted. Licensor reserves all rights not expressly granted.
                Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Owner shall not: (a) copy, modify, create derivative
                works from, or distribute the Digital Object(s); (b) display the Digital Object(s) other than as
                expressly licensed in Section 1.3; (c) copy, modify, create derivative works from, or distribute the
                Digital Asset(s); (d) use the Digital Asset(s) or Digital Object(s) to advertise, market or sell a
                product and/or service; (e) incorporate the Digital Asset(s) or Digital Object(s) in videos or other
                media; or (f) sell merchandise incorporating the Digital Asset(s) or Digital Object(s). Owner shall not
                sell or otherwise transfer the Digital Asset(s) if the license granted in Section 1.3 is expired or
                terminated for any reason. Upon a permitted transfer of ownership of the Digital Asset(s) by Owner to a
                third party, the license to the Digital Object(s) associated therewith shall be transferable solely
                subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, including those in Section 5.3, and the Owner's
                license to such Digital Object(s) terminates immediately upon transfer to such third party. Upon a
                non-permitted transfer of ownership of the Digital Asset(s) by Owner to a third party, the Owner's
                license to the Digital Object(s) associated therewith terminates immediately, and any purported transfer
                of the license to such Digital Object(s) to such third party shall be void. Owner agrees not to: (a)
                remove any copyright or other legal notices associated with the Digital Asset(s) or Digital Object(s);
                or (b) remove or alter any metadata of the Digital Asset(s), including without limitation, any link or
                other reference to license information. Failure to comply with the conditions set forth in Sections 1.3
                and 1.4 constitutes a material breach.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                2. IP Rights in the Digital Asset. Except as expressly set forth herein, Licensor retains all right,
                title, and interest in and to any intellectual property rights in the Digital Asset(s).
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                3. Disclaimer. LICENSOR MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY
                IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Owner
                understands and accepts the risks of blockchain technology. Without limiting the generality of the
                foregoing, Licensor does not warrant that the Digital Asset(s) or Digital Object(s) will perform without
                error. Further, Licensor provides no warranty regarding, and will have no responsibility for, any claim
                arising out of: (i) a modification of the Digital Asset(s) or Digital Object(s) made by anyone other
                than Licensor, unless Licensor approves such modification in writing; (ii) Owner's misuse of or
                misrepresentation regarding the Digital Asset(s) or Digital Object(s); or iii) any technology, including
                without limitation, any Platform, that fails to perform or ceases to exist. Licensor shall not be
                obligated to provide any support to Owner or any subsequent owner of the Digital Asset(s).
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; INDEMNITY.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                4.1. Dollar Cap. LICENSOR'S CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS OWNER
                AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OWNER PAID TO LICENSOR FOR DIGITAL ASSET(S).
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                4.2. Excluded Damages. IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR LOST PROFITS OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OR FOR
                ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
                OWNER AGREEMENT.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                4.3. Clarifications & Disclaimers. THE LIABILITIES LIMITED BY THIS SECTION 3 APPLY: (a) TO LIABILITY FOR
                NEGLIGENCE; (b) REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY,
                OR OTHERWISE; (c) EVEN IF LICENSOR IS ADVISED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DAMAGES IN QUESTION
                AND EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE; AND (d) EVEN IF OWNER'S REMEDIES FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL
                PURPOSE. If applicable law limits the application of the provisions of this Section 3, Licensor's
                liability will be limited to the maximum extent permissible. For the avoidance of doubt, Licensor's
                liability limits and other rights set forth in this Section 3 apply likewise to Licensor's affiliates,
                licensors, suppliers, advertisers, agents, sponsors, directors, officers, employees, consultants, and
                other representatives.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                4.4. Indemnity. Owner will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Licensors and its affiliates, and any of
                their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, and agents (“Licensor Indemnitees”)
                from and against any and all claims, causes of action, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses
                (including reasonable attorneys' fees and legal costs, which shall be reimbursed as incurred) arising
                out of, related to, or alleging Owner's breach of any provision in this agreement, including but not
                limited to Owner's failure to comply with the licensing conditions set forth in Section 1.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                5. Term & Termination.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                5.1. Term. This Owner Agreement shall continue until terminated pursuant to Subsection 5.2 or 5.3 below
                (the “Term”).
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                5.2. Termination for Transfer. The license granted in Section 1 above applies only to the extent that
                Owner continues to possess the applicable Digital Asset. If at any time the Owner sells, trades,
                donates, gives away, transfers, or otherwise disposes of a Digital Asset for any reason, this Owner
                Agreement, including without limitation, the license rights granted to Owner in Section 1 will
                immediately terminate, with respect to such Digital Asset, without the requirement of notice, and Owner
                will have no further rights in or to such Digital Asset or Digital Object(s) associated therewith.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                5.3. Termination for Cause. Licensor may terminate this Owner Agreement for Owner's material breach by
                written notice specifying in detail the nature of the breach, effective in thirty (30) days unless the
                Owner first cures such breach, or effective immediately if the breach is not subject to cure.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                5.4. Effects of Termination. Upon termination of this Owner Agreement, Owner shall cease all use of the
                Digital Object(s) and delete, destroy, or return all copies of the Digital Object(s) in its possession
                or control. Any provision of this Owner Agreement that must survive to fulfill its essential purpose
                will survive termination or expiration.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                6. MISCELLANEOUS.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                6.1. Independent Contractors. The parties are independent contractors and shall so represent themselves
                in all regards. Neither party is the agent of the other, and neither may make commitments on the other's
                behalf.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                6.2. Force Majeure. No delay, failure, or default, other than a failure to pay fees when due, will
                constitute a breach of this Owner Agreement to the extent caused by acts of war, terrorism, hurricanes,
                earthquakes, epidemics, other acts of God or of nature, strikes or other labor disputes, riots or other
                acts of civil disorder, embargoes, government orders responding to any of the foregoing, or other causes
                beyond the performing party's reasonable control.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                6.3. Assignment & Successors. Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth herein, including in
                Sections 1.4 and this Section 5.3, Owner may transfer ownership of the Digital Asset(s) to a
                third-party, provided that Owner: (i) has not breached this Owner Agreement prior to the transfer; (ii)
                notifies such third party that Licensor shall receive a royalty equal to 10% of the purchase price for
                any sale of a Digital Asset by such third-party; and (iii) Owner ensures that such third party is made
                aware of this Owner Agreement and agrees to be bound by the obligations and restrictions set forth
                herein. If the third party does not agree to be bound by the obligations and restrictions set forth
                herein, then the licenses granted herein shall terminate. In no case shall any of the license rights or
                other rights granted herein be transferrable apart from ownership of the Digital Asset. Except to the
                extent forbidden in this Section 5.3, this Owner Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit
                of the parties' respective successors and assigns. Any purported assignment or transfer in violation of
                this Section 5.3, including the transfer restriction in Section 1.4, shall be void. Only a single entity
                may own each Digital Asset at any time and only that entity shall have a license to the Digital
                Object(s) associated therewith. Upon transfer of a Digital Asset from a first user to a second user, the
                license to the first user for the Digital Object(s) associated with such Digital Asset shall immediately
                terminate. At no time may Owner fractionalize ownership of a Digital Asset and any purported attempt to
                do so shall be void and immediately terminate the licenses granted herein.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                6.4. Severability. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the parties hereby waive any provision of
                law that would render any clause of this Owner Agreement invalid or otherwise unenforceable in any
                respect. In the event that a provision of this Owner Agreement is held to be invalid or otherwise
                unenforceable, such provision will be interpreted to fulfill its intended purpose to the maximum extent
                permitted by applicable law, and the remaining provisions of this Owner Agreement will continue in full
                force and effect.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                6.5. No Waiver. Neither party will be deemed to have waived any of its rights under this Owner Agreement
                by lapse of time or by any statement or representation other than by an authorized representative in an
                explicit written waiver. No waiver of a breach of this Owner Agreement will constitute a waiver of any
                other breach of this Owner Agreement.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                6.6. Choice of Law & Jurisdiction: This Owner Agreement is governed by Maryland law and both parties
                submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Maryland and waive any
                right to challenge personal jurisdiction or venue.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                6.7. Entire Agreement. This Owner Agreement sets forth the entire agreement of the parties and
                supersedes all prior or contemporaneous writings, negotiations, and discussions with respect to its
                subject matter. Neither party has relied upon any such prior or contemporaneous communications.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                6.8. Amendment. This Owner Agreement may not be amended in any way except through a written agreement by
                authorized representatives of the Licensor and the current owner of the Digital Asset(s).
