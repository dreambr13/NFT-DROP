                The Site offers NFTs for sale. “NFTs” are non-fungible tokens, ownership of which are registered on a
                blockchain. NFTs are associated with digital objects (which may include images and/or other digital
                works) (“Digital Object(s)”). Except as expressly set forth herein and in the Owner Agreement (defined
                below), the purchase of an NFT does not grant purchaser ownership, or any other rights, to the Digital
                Objects.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                NFT Owner Agreement. Purchase of an NFT is subject to the “Owner Agreement” By purchasing an NFT you are
                agreeing to the terms and conditions set forth in the Owner Agreement. As detailed in the{' '}
                <Link href="/legal/nft-ownership-agreement" color="#FFCA21">
                    Owner Agreement
                </Link>
                , while a purchaser may own the NFT, they shall have only a limited license to the Digital Object(s),
                subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                NF3. The Site features certain NF3 NFTs (the “NF3 NFT(s)”) for sale. The claiming of a NF3 NFT entitles
                you to one of the total number of NF3 NFTs which can be used at a later date. The total supply of NF3 is
                rolling and is based on the number of 3 pointers scored by Stephen Curry in the 2022 playoff games. We
                reserve the right to increase the total supply of NF3 NFT in future sales.

                Payment Terms. You must have a valid wallet and form of payment that are compatible with the Ethereum
                blockchain on which the NF3 NFT was tokenized and minted with all necessary legal authorization to use
                that wallet and/or payment to complete the transaction.
